In the world of code so vast and wide,
Rust stands strong, with memory on its side.
No nulls to fear, no data race,
Safety and speed in every trace.

With lifetimes long and types so strong,
Bugs and crashes are proven wrong.
Concurrency with threads that never clash,
Rustâ€™s the language with a future so brash.

From systems low to the web above,
In Rust we trust, a language to love.
Compile time checks, borrow and own,
In Rust's embrace, we find our home.
